     * A very common problem which gives good insight into this is the Job Scheduling Problem.
     *
     * You have  jobs numbered  and you have the start times  and the end times  for the  job.
     * Which jobs should you choose such that you get the maximal set of non-overlapping jobs?
     *
     * The correct solution to this problem is to sort all the jobs on the basis of their end
     * times and then keep on selecting the job with the minimal index in this list which does
     * not overlap with currently selected jobs.
